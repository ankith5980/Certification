Q: What is EDA [Exploratory Data Analysis]
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and understanding data before applying any models or algorithms.

Types of Machine Learning :: 
    1.Supervised Learning
    2.Unsupervised Learning
    3.Reinforced Learning
    4.Semi - Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning Algorithms ::
    1.Linear Regression --> y = mx + c --> Continuous data analysis
    2.Logistic Regression --> Classification Based Data
    3.Decision Trees / Random Forerst

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms ::
    1.Deep Learning - Analyzes : Basic Patterns (Layer_1) -> Simple features (Layer_2) -> Complex Shapes (Layer_3) -> Full Recognition (Layer_4)
